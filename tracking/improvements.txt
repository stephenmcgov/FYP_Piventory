app bugs/improvements
-----------------------

- store default values on edit -> restore defaults button
store defaults in separate disabled field?

- can't click create/edit form multiple_price checkbox while single_price active

- all multiple prices displayed as size s on catalogue

- can't clear values on prev_eod_report form

- only store value returns search on prev_eod_report form

- should show all reports on load and filter instead of forcing search prev_eod_report form

- Hide product name field until image upload? / disable field

- enforce validation & typing for number fields (prevents api error display)

- prevent eod form submit if any field is NaN and enforce typing

- recover form data func? (use temp single file-writing?)

- add browse for product in catalogue func to stock report form?
